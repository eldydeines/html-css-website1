# html-css-website1
One of my first website developments - SkillCrush

After two weeks of learning HTML and CSS, I completed this in one afternoon.  I used a PSD to guide me in the design. I implemented containers using HTML 5 elements and used flexible widths in CSS. Quick to produce after learning those skills in SkillCrush 101 HTML & CSS Class.
